# What is goltoine ?

goltoine is an algorithm that generates a video in .avi format. GoL stands for Game of Life, it is a game of life where a cell is not black or white but an image among a set of images, that should be considered as an alphabet. Those images are elementary motives painted with acrylics, elementary because the pattern of the motif is meant to stay simple (thus two different colors is a good choice), not too complex (with the outline) since what is sought is to make emerge a global pattern with some complexity out of a bunch of low complexity elementary motives. By generating a dynamical global pattern we hoped to find some kind of meaning conveyed by the arrengements between the cells.
